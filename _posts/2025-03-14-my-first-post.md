Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post using the Tale theme.
Kitty power! and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail, yet licks your face or drink water out of the faucet so jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water yet drink water out of the faucet. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms.
